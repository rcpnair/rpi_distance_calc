# Raspberry PI Distance Calculator

## Introduction
Raspberry PI distance calculator is a simple PI project which can be used to measure distance between two points and forward the events to Splunk for further analysis. 
It uses GPIO modules to trigger an ultrasonic sensor and calculate the difference in time between send and recieve timestamps

## Components
